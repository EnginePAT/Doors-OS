# Hello! Welcome to the Doors OS project.

Doors OS is being developed as a parody operating system to the Microsoft Windows system. Currently I plan on adding:

  - EXT2 FileSystem Support
  - GDT/IDT
  - Audio Driver

Future plans are below. Please note that I do not know when these updates will come out. If you wish to contribute to the project, feel free to download the source code and commit a new branch.
Just a few rules if you are going to contribute:

  - Please follow all formatting rules. This should be in ```formatting.md```.
  - Please always commit to a new branch.
  - Use comments in your code so that others know what you are working on.
  - Keep comment language clean and helpful.

Thats it! Please give the repository a star or do whatever so that more people can find it. Other than that, I hope you enjoy Doors 11.

God bless,
